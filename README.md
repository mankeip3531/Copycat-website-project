The purpose of this project is to create a mock website, and I decided to make Pupilpath because I use Pupilpath
a lot as a student because I have to keep track of my grade in a daily basis. Throughout the process of making this website, I learned and practice the skills of using HTML and CSS. For example, I learned how to make the box looks transparent by changing the value of opacity. Moreover, I practiced and learned more about CSS by adjusting the padding and margin. I learned a new line of code `display:inline-block`, which wraps up all the elements in the list into a line of text. My next step is to make the website more interactive by adding more actual links instead deadlinks and make the users go to the dashboard when they press the `sign in` button.
